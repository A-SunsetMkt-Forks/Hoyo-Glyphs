# Update Log & Known Issues

## Teyvat Neue

### v1.002

Added the number `4`.

Slightly changed the number `3`.

### v1.001

Added these numbers:
```
0 1 2 3
```
Numbers currently appear in these 2 cases:

1. When someone is equipped with 4 or more **Husk of Opulent Dreams**
   artifacts. They will get a "Curiosity" effect after they make a
   Geo attack. The maximum stack is 4, and they lose 1 stack every
   6 seconds without making a Geo attack. When the number of stacks
   changes, a yellow number written in Common script is shown on them.

2. When **Yanfei** performs normal attack, she gets a Scarlet Seal.
   The maximum stack is 3 (4 if she got 6 constellations), and she loses all
   Scarlet Seals on a charged attack. Later, a scarlet number written in Common
   script is shown on her, indicating the number of Scarlet Seals consumed.
