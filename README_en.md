## Update Log & Known Issues

### Teyvat Neue

#### v1.002

Added the number `4`.

Slightly changed the number `3`.

#### v1.001

Added these numbers:
```
0 1 2 3
```
Numbers currently appear in these 2 cases:

1. When someone is equipped with 4 or more **Husk of Opulent Dreams**
   artifacts. They will get a "Curiosity" effect after they make a
   Geo attack. The maximum stack is 4, and they lose 1 stack every
   6 seconds without making a Geo attack. When the number of stacks
   changes, a yellow number written in Common script is shown on them.

2. When **Yanfei** performs normal attack, she gets a Scarlet Seal.
   The maximum stack is 3 (4 if she got 6 constellations), and she loses all
   Scarlet Seals on a charged attack. Later, a scarlet number written in Common
   script is shown on her, indicating the number of Scarlet Seals consumed.

According to the strokes of glyph, left and right kerning of all letters were

Added the letter `J`, and now the letter `L` is in its right place.

Letter `H` and `N` are now more condensed. 

#### v0.001

the ones you see in the game. These letters are:

```

I accidentally assign the shape of letter `L` to letter `J`, please update
