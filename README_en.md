## Update Log & Known Issues

### Inazuma Neue

`v0.2.0`

Added the letter `J`, and now the letter `L` is in its right place.

Letter `H` and `N` are now more condensed. 

`v0.1.0`

Some letters are from fuzzy screenshots, so they may differ from
the ones you see in the game. These letters are:

```
A B C D F L T W Y Z
```

Some letters are not yet implemented. These letters are:

```
P Q V X
```

I accidentally assign the shape of letter `L` to letter `J`, please update
the font as soon as possible.
